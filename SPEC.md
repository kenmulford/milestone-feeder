# milestone-feeder — as-built spec

A Claude Code plugin that turns a feature brief into a **GitHub milestone + small, well-formed issues** that `milestone-driver` can build with no human clarification. The direct predecessor of the driver.

Sibling of `milestone-driver`, same design DNA (see the suite plan: [`../dev-tools/SUITE-PLAN.md`](../dev-tools/SUITE-PLAN.md) §1). Separate plugin, separate config. Status: **as-built spec** — the live surface (verbs `plan` / `create` / `update` / `setup`, no flags, plan-file-as-contract), now with **user-owned, versioned milestone identity** (the semver lives in the milestone title), **`update` retargeting by deploy receipt + bounded rename-in-place**, and the **whole-app roadmap** (an oversized brief is carved into a confirmed, sequenced set of milestones, planned and deployed in build order — the v0.3.1 multi-milestone advisory is now its **trigger**, §3.1). The plugin version is not restated here — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the single source of truth.

Decisions already locked: name `milestone-feeder`; config at `.milestone-config/feeder.json`; separate plugin in its own repo (suite/marketplace linkage deferred). Decisions taken as sensible defaults below are marked **Decision (default)** — veto any.

## 1. Purpose & scope

One job: **turn a brief into a milestone of small, well-formed issues.** Input a brief; output a milestone whose issues each pass the driver's triage clean (`GAPS: none`).

Refuses, on purpose: writing code, opening PRs, touching branches, and **inventing product decisions** (what to build / user-facing behavior with no conventional default). It will make *implementation and design* decisions when the project docs or a repo convention supplies the answer; it will not make *product* calls — a decision with no conventional default it **flags for your decision**, never guesses.

Success criterion is testable: everything it emits is drafted to pass the same triage that gates the driver. The feeder targets the driver's triage bar as its quality bar (§5), so its quality bar *is* the driver's entry gate — no second, drifting definition of "well-formed" — but it does not run that gate itself; the driver's triage is where it is enforced.

---

## 2. Pipeline position

```
feature brief (file / inline / GitHub epic issue)
        │   reads project docs (.project/) + .milestone-config/driver.json (shared keys)
        ▼
   ┌───────────────┐   milestone + issues    ┌──────────────────┐
   │ milestone-feeder │ ──────────────────────▶ │ milestone-driver │ ──▶ merged PRs
   └───────────────┘  (pass triage clean)     └──────────────────┘
        │
        └── flags PRODUCT gaps for your decision → "needs product input" report (never invents scope)
```

The grounding line: `plan` reads the project's standing docs under `projectDocs` (default `.project/`) and resolves the shared keys (`sourceGlobs`, `uiSurfaceGlobs`, `integrationBranch`) from the driver config — never duplicated in `feeder.json`.

## 3. Plugin contents

| Component | Path | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plan` skill | `skills/plan/SKILL.md` | `/milestone-feeder:plan <brief>` | Compiles a reviewable **plan file** — brief → milestone + small, well-formed candidate issues, drafted to pass the driver's triage clean. **Read-only on GitHub** (writes only local scratch). |
| `create` skill | `skills/create/SKILL.md` | `/milestone-feeder:create <brief>` | Deploys the approved plan file to GitHub — labels + milestone + issues + build order. Read-the-plan, **faithful** (trusts the recorded plan; regenerates/re-checks nothing). |
| `update` skill | `skills/update/SKILL.md` | `/milestone-feeder:update <brief>` | Reconciles a refreshed plan onto an existing milestone — safe, **never-close**, idempotent. |
| `setup` skill | `skills/setup/SKILL.md` | `/milestone-feeder:setup` (or auto by `plan`) | Bootstraps `.milestone-config/feeder.json`; aligns the issue-label taxonomy with the driver's. Mirrors `milestone-driver:setup`. |
| `build-roadmap` skill | `skills/build-roadmap/SKILL.md` | **internal** — invoked by `plan` (Step 3.6) on an oversized whole-app brief; never a user command | Turns one oversized brief into a confirmed, sequenced roadmap of milestones: dispatches `roadmap-splitter` once, surfaces the split for the user to confirm / merge / split / reorder / reject, and on confirmation writes a roadmap manifest to `.milestone-feeder/roadmap-<slug>.md`. **Read-only on GitHub** (writes one local scratch manifest). See §3.1 (the roadmap). |
| `architect` agent | `agents/architect.md` (id `milestone-feeder:architect`) | dispatched by `plan`, **once** per run | The architect lens: brief + project docs + repo → candidate issues + dependency graph + build order (Wave order). One heavy reasoning step. Raises the `SCOPE_SPANS_MULTIPLE_MILESTONES` signal that triggers the roadmap route. Also consults the implied-surfaces reference and labels each conventional companion surface it proposes with the `disposition: implied` field (§3.1, implied surfaces). |
| `issue-author` agent | `agents/issue-author.md` (id `milestone-feeder:issue-author`) | dispatched by `plan`, once **per candidate** | Per-issue spec authoring to the §4 output contract. Keeps each authoring ask small — the breakdown-for-quality principle applied to writing, not just building. |
| `roadmap-splitter` agent | `agents/roadmap-splitter.md` (id `milestone-feeder:roadmap-splitter`) | dispatched by `build-roadmap`, **once** per run | The roadmap lens: an oversized whole-app brief + project docs → a strict, build-ordered partition into named milestones (the `ROADMAP` block). Read-only; supersedes the architect's passive multi-milestone advisory with a real, ordered split. |
| `implied-surfaces` reference | `docs/implied-surfaces.md` | consulted by `architect` during breakdown | The stack-agnostic implied-surfaces **reasoning reference** — the standard companion surfaces a capability or new entity implies, framed as a reviewable **floor** (a start, never a scope-emitting catalog). Also **defines** the optional project-local overlay (`.milestone-config/implied-surfaces.md`, additive-merge). PR-able; shipped so the capability set grows by community PR. See §3.1 (implied surfaces). |
| Manifest + registration | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `hooks/hooks.json` | — | Plugin metadata + hook registration. |
| Hook: `no-source-edit` | `hooks/` | PreToolUse (`Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit`) | Deny edits to `sourceGlobs`. The feeder reads code, never writes it. The only mechanical gate it needs (it authors no code and opens no PRs, so the driver's other gates don't apply). |

**Targets the driver's triage, does not run it.** The feeder authors every issue to the same five criteria `milestone-driver`'s `triage-reviewer` / `design-reviewer` check (§4), so its quality bar *is* the driver's entry gate — one shared definition of "well-formed." But the feeder runs **no** reviewer of its own: the driver's triage is the single automated gate, run once after `create`, and the human reviews the plan file before `create` (§5).

---

## 3.1 The plan-file contract — the load-bearing build artifact

The plan file is the **interface** between `plan` (which writes it) and `create` / `update` (which read it, and regenerate nothing). The mental model: **the plan file is the spec; GitHub is the deployment.** `plan` compiles it; `create` deploys it fresh; `update` re-deploys it onto an existing milestone.

`plan` writes it to a gitignored per-run scratch path, by a **deterministic slug** of the milestone goal, so `create` / `update` resolve the same path from the same brief:

```
.milestone-feeder/plan-<slug>.md
```

Derive `<slug>` deterministically from the one-line milestone goal: lowercase it, replace every run of non-alphanumeric characters with a single hyphen, strip any leading/trailing hyphen, and cap the length at a reasonable bound (trimming a trailing hyphen if the cut lands on one). The same brief always resolves to the same path; a **changed** brief derives a **different** slug — that is the staleness signal (`create` / `update` re-plan when the slug no longer matches).

### Fields a consumer parses (the contract)

The plan file MUST carry, unambiguously, every field below:

| Field | Why `create` / `update` need it |
|---|---|
| **Milestone title (exact)** + one-line goal | The **identity field**: `create` / `update` resolve the milestone by this exact title (create-or-adopt). Now **user-owned and carrying the semver** — the version lives inside this one title string (there is no separate version field), and the driver parses the version from it. Distinct from the one-line goal, which is descriptive only. |
| **Milestone number (GitHub):** `<n>` — the deploy receipt | The stable handle for `update`: `create` writes it post-deploy; `plan` preserves it on re-plan; `update` resolves the milestone by it (surviving a title change) and renames on a title diff. Additive — a plan file lacking it still parses. |
| **Version provenance** (one line: `explicit` \| `declaration` \| `inferred from <tag/milestone>` \| `prompted`) | Records which ladder rung resolved the title (§7) so the surfaced default is legible — the user can trust or correct it. |
| **Multi-milestone advisory** — the `SCOPE_SPANS_MULTIPLE_MILESTONES` flag + proposed split, when raised | Surfaces the guardrail when a brief reads as several milestones. Additive / optional. Present **only on the retained path** — the architect raised the signal **and** the front-door (Step 3.6) did **not** route the brief into the roadmap flow (the route was declined, degraded, or resolved to a single milestone); on that path it **does not change what gets deployed** (the plan stays a deployable single milestone). **Superseded** when the roadmap route is taken — the confirmed roadmap (§3.1, "The roadmap") is surfaced in its place, so this advisory is omitted. |
| **Milestone description** (Wave / build order, local slugs `#A`/`#B`) | The wave-encoded description to PATCH onto the milestone after issue numbers exist. |
| **Per surviving issue** — slug, title, the FULL §4 body verbatim, labels, surface/risk | The issues to create / patch — verbatim, **no regeneration**. |
| **Parked issues** — slug, title, kind (`product-gap`) | Marked, **never created.** Routed to the needs-input report. |
| **Dropped issues** — slug, title, the parked dependency that dropped them | Marked, **never created** (a dependent of a parked issue can't build). |
| **Source brief reference** — `inline` \| `file:<path>` \| `epic #<n>` | Drives report routing and the brief↔plan match. An `epic #<n>` reference routes the needs-input report to an epic comment. |

### The slug→`#n` rewrite happens at write time

Issue numbers don't exist until creation, so the plan file carries **local slugs** (`#A`/`#B`) throughout. The load-bearing two-pass slug→`#n` rewrite happens when `create` / `update` write to GitHub — once the issues exist and the slug→`#n` map is complete. `plan` itself does no rewrite.

**What changed from v0.2.0 is ONLY the source** of the issue bodies / labels / waves: they are now **read from the plan file, not regenerated.** The write sequence (label ensure, create-or-adopt, two-pass slug→`#n`, report routing) is unchanged.

### v0.3.1 — user-owned versioned identity, `update` retargeting, the multi-milestone guardrail

v0.3.1 is an **additive** release on this surface — no command or config breaks, the new plan-file fields above degrade gracefully (a v0.3.0 plan file lacking them still parses), and the change is in **where a milestone's identity comes from and how the family carries it**, not in the `plan → create → update` pipeline. Three behaviors:

> **Discovery / migration-path principle (normative).** Every new feature, config key, or behavior change must ship an existing-user **discovery / migration path** — a one-time notice, a setup re-run prompt, or a documented upgrade note — so an existing user *finds out* about it, not only that their old config keeps working. **Non-breaking is necessary but NOT sufficient:** additive / degrades-gracefully guarantees the old config keeps *working* (the §7 read-as-fallback mechanism, `SPEC.md` §7); this principle adds the complementary half — the user *discovers* it. It is the same spirit as "never silently invents an identity the user can't see or change" (above), applied to new capability rather than identity. The canonical reference implementation is the driver's one-time-notice pattern: the first-run preflight notice (`milestone-driver/skills/solve-milestone/SKILL.md`, step 2.1 — gated on a per-clone marker so it shows at most once) and its sibling one-time Trello upgrade notice (same file, step 1.2); the feeder applies the same pattern in `plan` Step 0 (the legacy-blanket notice and the un-bootstrapped grounding-is-weak nudge, both marker-gated to show at most once per clone). **Enforcement split (recorded plainly):** this issue makes the principle (a) **normative** here and (b) a stated issue-authoring **quality bar** in §4 (the Completeness criterion) — what the feeder DRAFTS every issue to satisfy. Enforcement is the **driver's triage** — the single automated entry gate the feeder targets but does not run (§5); making triage enforce the principle requires a **companion criterion in the driver's `triage-reviewer`**, a cross-repo, driver-side change that is **out of scope here** and recorded as a related follow-up (filed as milestone-driver issue #224).

- **User-owned, versioned milestone identity.** The milestone title is now a **user-owned field** carrying the **semver inside it** (e.g. `myapp v1.2.0`) — there is **no separate version field**, because the driver derives its target version by parsing the milestone title for a semver. The user can state the title up front (inline or as a `Milestone: <name> vX.Y.Z` line in the brief); if they don't, `plan` resolves a default by a **layered, first-match-wins ladder** — *explicit* up front → the project's `versioning` declaration (§7) → *inference* from the highest semver among existing milestone titles, else the latest `vX.Y.Z` git tag → a one-time *prompt* only when nothing is inferable. The resolved title and a one-line **version provenance** are **surfaced in the plan file for confirm/override before `create`** — `plan` never silently invents an identity the user can't see or change. A `"none"` declaration means no version and no prompt; non-versioned projects are left alone.

- **`update` retargeting + bounded rename-in-place.** Because identity is now the explicit title (not a goal-derivative), `update` resolves the **source plan** by the brief slug but the **target milestone** by the identity — so a revised plan in a new brief file reconciles onto its existing milestone. To survive a title change, `create` writes the GitHub milestone number back into the plan file as a **deploy receipt** (`Milestone number (GitHub): <n>`); `update` resolves **by that number first** (falling back to title-match when absent), and when it resolved by number and the plan's title differs, it **PATCHes the new title** — the single bounded way `update` mutates a milestone's identity. A wholesale new brief with a new title and no receipt → title-match → no match → **error-and-stop directing you to `create`**, with the one-line `gh` rename command for the rare true-rename case. `plan` carries the receipt forward on re-plan so the handle isn't stranded.

- **The multi-milestone guardrail (advisory → roadmap trigger).** v0.3.1 made the feeder stop being silent about a brief that's really several: when a brief reads as distinct phased deliverables / release boundaries, the architect raises `SCOPE_SPANS_MULTIPLE_MILESTONES` with a proposed split. In v0.3.1 this was **advisory only** — `plan` still wrote a deployable single-milestone plan and prominently flagged *"this looks like ~N milestones"*, leaving the split for the user to make by hand. **As of the roadmap (below, "The roadmap"), this same signal is the TRIGGER for a real `brief → N-milestones` split**: when it is raised, `plan`'s front-door routes the brief into `build-roadmap`, which carves it into a confirmed, sequenced set of milestones and plans them all. The passive advisory is now **retained only as the backstop** when that route is declined or degrades. **Still never a hard block, never a silent giant milestone** — the user always confirms. The full `brief → N-milestones` decomposition that v0.3.1 deferred to a future release now ships.

### The roadmap — an oversized brief → a confirmed, sequenced set of milestones

The feeder is no longer **one brief → one milestone** for an oversized whole-app brief. The single-milestone pipeline (Steps 1–7, §6) is now a **named, callable inner routine**, and `plan` wraps it in a **conditional outer loop**: the default single-brief path invokes the routine **exactly once** (byte-for-byte the prior behavior), and an oversized brief routes through `build-roadmap` and invokes the routine **once per milestone the roadmap names, in build order**. Milestone identity, the version ladder, and the plan file are all the routine's — unchanged; only how many times the routine runs, and against which brief slice, changes.

**The trigger is the v0.3.1 advisory, promoted.** The architect's `SCOPE_SPANS_MULTIPLE_MILESTONES` signal (above, the guardrail) is the **sole arbiter** of "oversized" — the front-door (`plan` Step 3.6) introduces no second threshold of its own. Signal `none` → `plan` runs the single-milestone routine once on the whole brief, unchanged. Signal raised → the front-door routes the brief into `build-roadmap` instead of passively flagging it.

**The `build-roadmap` routine** (`skills/build-roadmap/SKILL.md`) — an **internal** skill, invoked by `plan`, never a user command:

1. **Split.** Dispatch `roadmap-splitter` **once** — it returns a `ROADMAP` block: a strict, build-ordered partition of the brief into named milestones (every part of the brief in exactly one milestone, none dropped or duplicated; positions `1..N`).
2. **One confirmation checkpoint.** Surface the proposed split for the user to **confirm / merge / split / reorder / reject** — a single up-front sign-off **before anything is written** (`.project/design-philosophy.md#One-way doors`). A user edit is re-verified as a strict partition; on reject, nothing is written.
3. **Manifest.** On confirmation, write a **roadmap manifest** (`.milestone-feeder/roadmap-<slug>.md`) — the cross-milestone build artifact: which milestones to plan, in what order, plus the **full original brief** (a durable record of what the roadmap was built from). It carries no per-milestone §4 issue bodies — those live in each milestone's own `plan-<slug>.md`.

**Parallel per-milestone planning** (`plan` Step 3.7). `plan` consumes the confirmed manifest and runs the single-milestone inner routine **once per milestone, in build order**, fanning the per-milestone planning out in parallel. Each milestone's version + exact title is resolved **once, on the main thread, before the fan-out** (the version ladder's one interactive rung can never run inside a background subagent) and handed into the routine; each milestone gets its own plan file at a collision-disambiguated path the manifest records.

**`create` deploys all, in order.** When a roadmap manifest exists for the brief, `create` (Step 1R) **loops its unchanged per-plan deploy** over the manifest's milestones in build order, recording each one's cross-milestone position as a single `build order: milestone X of N` line in its description. The single-plan path is the **N=1** case, byte-for-byte unchanged.

**Discovery / migration path (the §3.1 normative principle).** The roadmap is a behavior change for existing users — a whole-app brief that used to get only the passive *"~N milestones"* advisory now routes into the roadmap flow — so it ships a discovery path: `plan` Step 0 prints a **one-time, per-clone** notice announcing the new routing (marker-gated, read-only, non-blocking), and this section documents it. **No new config key** — the roadmap reuses the existing `projectDocs` grounding; nothing in `feeder.json` or `setup` changes. **Single / normal briefs are unchanged** — the roadmap never triggers for a brief the architect reads as one coherent release, and a user who declines the split falls straight back to today's single-milestone plan.

### Implied companion surfaces — capability-aware completeness

A brief names a capability — "add email", "user management", "sync" — or introduces a new entity, and that name quietly commits to a standard set of companion surfaces (screens, endpoints, jobs, settings) the brief never spells out. Left to only what is literally written, those companions surface one-at-a-time mid-build as unplanned rework. So during breakdown the **`architect` consults a curated, stack-agnostic implied-surfaces reference** (`docs/implied-surfaces.md`) — a **reasoning prompt / floor**, NOT a scope-emitting catalog — and for each named capability or new entity the brief invokes, considers the companions it implies, sorting each with the **same grounded-vs-product-gap judgment it already applies** (`agents/architect.md` clause 8; the rigor gate's recognized dispositions):

- **Conventional companion** (a standard surface with a conventional default — e.g. email → a delivery-failure log; a Users entity → reset-password) → proposed as a **default-in candidate for review**, riding `CANDIDATES` with the architect's optional `disposition: implied` field. It is *proposed for review*, never committed scope: it lands in a plan the human approves before any issue exists, fully reversible (trim a line before approving).
- **Genuine product-call** (no conventional default — e.g. a suppression / unsubscribe policy) → **parked via `PRODUCT_GAPS`**, never silently pre-included. The never-invent floor (§2, the park boundary) holds for implied surfaces too — a companion that can be neither grounded in a default nor tied to a real product decision is never emitted as `implied`.

The reference's three triggers: the **new-entity baseline** (list / detail / create / edit / delete / states / permissions / audit) is considered **per entity**; **named capabilities** are **concept-matched, not keyword-matched** ("let admins message members" is the email capability without the word "email"); **cross-cutting** concerns (search / filter / sort, background jobs) are considered **once at the app level**. **States** (empty / loading / error / unauthorized) are *considered* so they are never overlooked but land as acceptance criteria inside their own screen issue (`agents/issue-author.md` Completeness), never as standalone issues. Fanned-out surfaces reuse the architect's existing ~1-PR sizing — granularity is not this clause's job.

**The disposition threads architect → plan → issue-author → plan file.** `plan` captures the optional `disposition` (`grounded | implied`, default/omitted = `grounded`) verbatim alongside each candidate (Step 3), threads it into the issue-author brief (Step 4; `agents/issue-author.md` is made aware of it), and at Step 7 renders each `implied` candidate **distinctly** — carrying the `[implied — review / trim / augment]` marker on its issue heading. **Only when the plan carries at least one implied candidate**, `plan` fires a structural **anti-fixation prompt** at the same confirm/override moment the user already sees the milestone identity — the verbatim `this is a starting set for YOUR app — what's missing?` — advisory and non-blocking, so the user reviews / trims / augments before `create`. When no candidate is `implied`, nothing here surfaces — no marker, no prompt — byte-for-byte as before. The field is **additive**: every downstream consumer reads `tag` / `title` / `surface` / `risk` / `sketch` and is unaffected by its presence.

**The project-local overlay (additive).** The bundled reference is universal, so a project extends it with an **optional overlay** at the fixed path `.milestone-config/implied-surfaces.md` — discovered by that fixed path, **NOT a `feeder.json` key** (`docs/profile-schema.md`). `plan` Step 0 resolves and merges it into the bundled reference **additively**: an overlay can **add** a capability and **extend** an existing one, but **never remove** a surface the global reference defines (per-run trimming is the plan review's job). An absent overlay (the common case) → the bundled reference is used unchanged, no error; a malformed overlay is skipped best-effort and never breaks a run.

**Discovery / migration path (the §3.1 normative principle).** The overlay is a new optional surface, so it ships an existing-user discovery path: `setup` Phase 2 mentions it (informational — discovered by a fixed path, not a key), and `plan` / `update` Step 0 print a shared **one-time, per-clone** notice that names the overlay and explains its additive merge (marker-gated, read-only, non-blocking). **No schema change** — the overlay is a fixed-path file, not a key, so nothing in `feeder.json` / `driver.json` / `setup` changes. **Single / normal briefs are unchanged** — a brief invoking no capability and introducing no new entity breaks down exactly as before (the architect's clause-8 consult is a no-op); and the reference, being a floor not a ceiling, never *guarantees* completeness — the anti-fixation prompt is the built-in step that asks for what a curated list can't know.

### The `create` → driver handoff (build kickoff)

When `create` finishes building a milestone and its issues, it can hand the milestone **straight to `milestone-driver`** to start building — closing the feeder→driver seam — instead of ending the run and leaving the user to invoke the driver. It is **build-kickoff only**: it invokes `/milestone-driver:solve-milestone "<exact milestone title>"` (the title `create` deployed, carrying the user-owned semver), and **never** authors code, merges, or crosses the release boundary itself. Governed by the own-key **`autoHandoff`** (§7) — `"prompt"` (default, ask), `"auto"` (kick off immediately), or `"off"` (never); an unrecognized value is treated as `"prompt"`. (Resolved design: milestone-feeder issue #148; re-homed from milestone-driver #232. Feeder-side minor bump, milestone v0.5.0.)

**Three gates — ALL must hold to offer the handoff:**

1. **Clean run only — no gaps/parks.** The run produced no product gap and parked / dropped nothing (the plan file's `## Needs human input` pointer is "none" — the same signal `create` pass (e) reads). A gapped run surfaces its gaps as today and offers no handoff — the human stays in the loop on any run with known gaps.
2. **Driver installed, else silent skip.** `create` detects whether `/milestone-driver:solve-milestone` resolves in this session; if it does **not**, it silently skips — no prompt, no error — exactly as the optional `milestone-driver` soft-dependency degrades silently elsewhere (`docs/consumer-setup.md` §1).
3. **Never crosses `develop → main`.** `solve-milestone` merges only to the integration branch; release (`develop → main`), closing the milestone object, and deploy stay manual and human-only (`milestone-driver/skills/solve-milestone/SKILL.md` "Bounded blast radius"). The handoff never auto-merges to a protected branch and never removes the release gate — it preserves the autonomy boundary (`.project/design-philosophy.md#One-way doors`).

**Discovery path (the §3.1 normative principle).** As an additive behavior whose default (`"prompt"`) is a **new** behavior for existing users, `autoHandoff` ships a discovery path: `setup` Phase 2 presents it (a plain-language label + skip-consequence), `docs/profile-schema.md` documents the key (table row + per-key note), and the default is visible. To keep exactly today's no-handoff behavior, a user sets `"off"`.

## 4. Output contract — the interface to the driver

Maps 1:1 to the five criteria the driver's triage checks. The issue-author guarantees each.

| Triage criterion | What the feeder guarantees |
|---|---|
| Consistency | Each issue's recorded design is internally non-contradictory. |
| Buildability | Every decision the criteria require is recorded, or resolvable by a *stated* repo convention — nothing left for the implementer to invent. |
| Completeness | Acceptance criteria enumerate states, branches, and error / empty / disabled paths — not just the happy path — and, **when the change affects existing users or their config**, an existing-user **discovery path** (the normative principle, §3.1): a one-time notice, a setup re-run prompt, or a documented upgrade note. Scoped — a change touching neither existing users nor existing config (pure greenfield) carries no discovery-path requirement. The driver's one-time-notice pattern (`milestone-driver/skills/solve-milestone/SKILL.md`, steps 2.1 / 1.2) is the canonical example. |
| Dependencies | Hard dependencies are declared as edges, and the **milestone description encodes the Wave order** (the source triage reads via `gh api .../milestones .description`). |
| UI flag | Each issue is classified UI vs logic; UI issues carry the spec the design-reviewer needs (states, affordances, accessibility, the existing pattern to mirror). |

### Issue body template

```markdown
## Summary
<one paragraph: what changes and why, in product terms>

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] <happy path, observable>
- [ ] <empty state>
- [ ] <error / failure path>
- [ ] <disabled / edge state>

## Design (recorded, consistent)
<the decisions an implementer would otherwise have to invent — grounded in the
project docs or a cited sibling pattern. No contradictions.>
- Convention followed: <conventions.md ref or file:line of the sibling pattern>

## Dependencies
- Depends on #<n> — <one-line reason / the exact reference>

## Classification
- Surface: UI | logic
- Risk: light | heavy   (sets the driver's risk:* override; default heavy when unsure)
```

Labels applied by **`create`**: a UI/logic label, and `risk:light` / `risk:heavy` when the feeder is confident — aligned with the driver's existing taxonomy so triage and solve read them natively. The four-label set (`ui`, `logic`, `risk:light`, `risk:heavy`) is provisioned by `setup` and ensured idempotently by `create`.

### Milestone description template (encodes the Wave order)

```markdown
<one-paragraph milestone goal>

## Waves
- Wave 1 (parallel): #A, #B, #C
- Wave 2: #D (depends on #A, #B)
- Wave 3: #E (depends on #D)
```

Human-readable and the exact ordering source `solve-milestone` and triage consume. In the plan file the identifiers are **local slugs**; `create` rewrites them to real GitHub numbers once the issues exist.

---

## 5. The quality bar — the driver's triage (targeted, not run)

The feeder's quality bar *is* the driver's entry gate: every issue it drafts is authored to pass the driver's `triage-reviewer` (and `design-reviewer` for UI issues) clean (`GAPS: none`) — one shared definition of "well-formed," never a second drifting copy. But the feeder runs **no** reviewer gate of its own. It **DRAFTS** issues that **TARGET** that bar; the driver's own triage is the **single automated entry gate**, run once after `create` when the driver picks the milestone up. Between them stands the human: `plan` writes a reviewable plan file, and the human reviews it before `create` deploys.

| Concern in the issue | How the feeder targets the bar |
|---|---|
| Design / implementation decision with a conventional default | Recorded and cited (`.project/<doc>.md#<section>` or a sibling `file:line`), so the driver's Buildability check clears. |
| Genuine **product** gap (no conventional default) | Flagged for your decision in the "needs product input" report; never invented (§2 park boundary). |
| UI issue | Carries the states, affordances, accessibility, and existing pattern to mirror that the driver's `design-reviewer` checks. |

The `reviewer` own-key and its `"milestone-driver" | "internal" | false` backends are **retired** — the feeder no longer selects or runs a reviewer backend, so there is no in-feeder gate to configure. An existing profile that still carries a `reviewer` key is **ignored gracefully** (unknown key → no error).

## 6. Procedure (the `plan` skill)

`plan` runs the full pipeline (Steps 0–5) and stops at a reviewable plan file (Step 7). It is **read-only on GitHub** — its entire output is local scratch files.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 0 | Read `.milestone-config/feeder.json` (absent → `setup`); read the project docs (`projectDocs`, default `.project/`, best-effort); resolve the shared keys (`sourceGlobs`, `uiSurfaceGlobs`, `integrationBranch`) from the driver config. |
| 1 | Ingest the brief (file path, inline text, or a GitHub epic issue); normalize freeform input internally first. |
| 2 | **Product-gap check** (the flag boundary): separate product decisions (no conventional default) from design/implementation decisions (resolvable from project docs/convention). Product gaps are recorded, not guessed. |
| 3 | Dispatch the **`architect`** agent **once**: candidate issue set (small, independently-buildable, ~one PR each) + dependency edges + Wave order. |
| 4 | Dispatch the **`issue-author`** agent **per candidate** (parallelizable) → full spec to §4. |
| 5 | Resolve the **milestone identity** — the user-owned exact title carrying the semver, by the v0.3.1 layered ladder (explicit → declaration → inference → prompt; §3.1), with its version provenance; **drop parked issues + their dependents**; assemble the dependency graph; render the milestone description (§4) with local slugs. |
| 7 | **Write the plan file** (`.milestone-feeder/plan-<slug>.md`) — the build artifact (§3.1), plus the needs-input report when anything was parked; **surface the resolved identity (title + provenance) for confirm/override**, and the multi-milestone advisory **when raised**, before `create`; **carry forward** an existing deploy receipt on re-plan. No GitHub writes. |

**The roadmap path wraps this routine (§3.1, "The roadmap").** Steps 1–7 above are a **callable single-milestone inner routine**; Step 0 is the once-per-run outer boundary. On the default single-brief path the routine runs **exactly once** on the whole brief. When the architect raises `SCOPE_SPANS_MULTIPLE_MILESTONES`, `plan`'s front-door (**Step 3.6**) instead routes the brief into the internal `build-roadmap` skill — split → one confirmation checkpoint → roadmap manifest — and then (**Step 3.7**) runs the inner routine **once per milestone, in build order**, fanning out in parallel. Each milestone emits its own plan file; the single-milestone routine itself is unchanged. Steps 3.6 and 3.7 are outer, run-level orchestration — a dispatched per-milestone routine never re-enters them, so the fan-out cannot recurse.

**Then `create` deploys the plan file** (faithful — the §6 apply write sequence): ensure labels → create-or-adopt the milestone by exact title → create the surviving issues + build the slug→`#n` map → second-pass slug→`#n` rewrite (issue bodies + the milestone description) → file the needs-input report (epic comment when the brief was an epic; else local file). On the found path it dispatches no agent and re-checks nothing. After the milestone is resolved, `create` **writes the deploy receipt** (`Milestone number (GitHub): <n>`) back into the plan file — the stable handle `update` later resolves by (a back-write failure is a reported notice, never a blocked deploy, since the plan file is gitignored scratch). **On a roadmap run** (`create` **Step 1R**) `create` loops this same per-plan deploy over the manifest's milestones in build order, recording each one's `build order: milestone X of N` line; the single-plan path is the unchanged N=1 case.

**And `update` reconciles it** onto an existing milestone (create-or-patch / add-edge-and-re-render / flag-never-close / no-op): it resolves the milestone **by the deploy-receipt number first** (falling back to exact-title when absent) and, when resolved by number with a changed plan title, **renames the milestone in place** (a single bounded title PATCH) before reconciling; then create any plan issue missing on GitHub, patch any drifted body (showing the diff first), add any new dependency edge and re-render the build order, and **flag** — never close — any live issue the plan no longer carries. A wholesale new brief with a new title and no receipt → no title match → **error-and-stop directing you to `create`**, with the one-line `gh` rename command for the rare true-rename case. A fully-synced milestone is a true no-op.

There are **no flags** anywhere: `plan` previews (writes the plan file), `create` / `update` write — each *is* its own verb.

## 7. Config schema — `.milestone-config/feeder.json`

Thin and consumer-driven, same discipline as the driver: new keys only when a real consumer needs them. The file name stays `feeder.json` (pairs with `driver.json`, matches the plugin name, avoids hook-script churn). The keys inside — the part a user reads and edits — are humanized.

| Key | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `projectDocs` | string | `.project/` | Where the project's standing docs live. |
| `autoHandoff` | `"prompt" \| "auto" \| "off"` | `"prompt"` | After `create` builds a milestone, whether the feeder offers to hand it to `milestone-driver` to start building (`"prompt"` = ask; `"auto"` = start immediately; `"off"` = never). Unrecognized → treated as `"prompt"`. See §3 (the create→driver handoff). |
| `versioning` | `"semver" \| "none"` | *(none)* — absent is a distinct "infer-or-ask" state | Whether this project is semver-versioned; drives milestone-version resolution at plan time (three-way: `"semver"` = version every milestone, `"none"` = never add a version or prompt, **absent** = infer from repo signals else prompt). |
| `issueSize` | string | *(none)* | Optional natural-language sizing rule (e.g. "≤1 PR, ≤1 new screen"). |
| `architectAgent` | string | `milestone-feeder:architect` | Override the breakdown (architect) agent. |
| `issueAuthorAgent` | string | `milestone-feeder:issue-author` | Override the authoring agent. |
| `sourceGlobs` | string[] | `["skills/**","agents/**","hooks/**"]` | **Self-protection only** — the paths the feeder's own `no-source-edit` hook guards in the feeder's *own* repo. Distinct from the consumer's shared `sourceGlobs`. |

Consumer-facing shared keys (`uiSurfaceGlobs`, `integrationBranch`, and the *consumer's* `sourceGlobs`) are **read from the driver config, not duplicated** — resolved `.milestone-config/driver.json` → root `milestone-driver.json`.

The `sourceGlobs` key above is **self-protection only**: the `no-source-edit` hook, which guards the feeder's *own* repo, resolves the paths to guard **`feeder.json` first, then falls back to the resolved driver config (`.milestone-config/driver.json` → root `milestone-driver.json`), then fail-open** if neither carries it. This own-repo self-edit guard is semantically distinct from the consumer's shared `sourceGlobs` that the feeder reads from the driver config when planning a target repo.

### `.milestone-config/` migration note

Adopting `.milestone-config/` suite-wide means the driver resolves its profile from `.milestone-config/driver.json` first, falling back to the legacy root `milestone-driver.json` (backward-compatible — existing repos keep working).

## 8. Modes & autonomy

Three intent-named verbs, **zero flags**. Each verb *is* the explanation of what it does.

| Verb | Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `plan` | `/milestone-feeder:plan <brief>` | Full procedure, stops at a reviewable plan file (read-only on GitHub). |
| `create` | `/milestone-feeder:create <brief>` | Deploys the approved plan file: labels + milestone + issues + build order. Faithful — trusts the recorded plan (regenerates/re-checks nothing); runs `plan` first if no plan file exists for the brief. |
| `update` | `/milestone-feeder:update <brief>` | Reconciles a refreshed plan onto the existing milestone. Never closes/deletes; idempotent; shows the diff before patching. |

Authoring autonomy boundary: makes design/implementation calls grounded in the project docs; flags product calls (no conventional default) for your decision in the "needs product input" report. Authors no code, opens no PRs, never touches branches.

## 9. Build order (dogfood it)

Build the feeder as its own milestone the driver can run — the as-built sequence:

1. **Agent + config rename** — `architect` agent; keys `projectDocs` / `issueSize` / `architectAgent`; `setup` updated. (The spine — no behavior change.)
2. **`plan` skill** — the plan file becomes the formalized contract (§3.1); drop the apply path.
3. **`create` skill** — read-the-plan deploy + run-`plan`-first fallback; inherits the §6 apply write sequence.
4. **`update` skill** — plan-driven reconcile; never-close, idempotent.
5. **README / docs / metadata** re-vocab to the new surface.
6. **Harness** migrate + re-run (the credibility scenarios, on the new verbs/keys).
7. **Verify** the old vocabulary is gone; bump to v0.3.0.

Steps 1–2 are the spine with no irreversible GitHub side effects — the safe first build target.

---

## 10. Resolved during build (was: open questions)

These were settled by the as-built skills:

- **Brief format.** Accepted **freeform** and normalized internally first into `{ goal, in-scope, out-of-scope, surfaces, epicIssueNumber? }` before anything downstream consumes it (`skills/plan/SKILL.md` Step 1).
- **Milestone ownership.** **Create-or-adopt** by exact title — `create` creates the milestone if no title match, adopts (and reopens if closed) an existing one; never deletes (`skills/create/SKILL.md` pass b). `update` adopts read-only and errors-and-stops if no milestone exists.
- **Where the "needs product input" report lives.** A **local file** (`.milestone-feeder/needs-product-input-<slug>.md`) — or a **comment on the epic issue** when the brief was a GitHub epic. `plan` writes the report body; `create` / `update` route it by the recorded source-brief reference (`skills/create/SKILL.md` pass e).
